# Denoisers

This is a repo for several denoising projects - passive source OBS data at high frequencies and active source OBS data; in the future depending on funding decisions some more should be added. 

Code based on Thomas et al., 2023; code at https://github.com/amtseismo/hrgnss_denoising. Yes, it's not sourced from that git correctly. 

The main script is CNN_Unet.py; Network_Comparisons.py prints examples from the validation set. There are a lot of experimental scripts from before I was properly version controlling. This needs to be cleaned up; currently on travel.
